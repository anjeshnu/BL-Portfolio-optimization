    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Portfolio construction in multi-asset settings is fundamentally challenged by the\n",
    "estimation of expected returns. While asset return covariances can often be estimated\n",
    "with reasonable stability, expected returns are notoriously noisy and highly sensitive\n",
    "to sampling error. Traditional mean–variance optimization amplifies this instability,\n",
    "frequently producing extreme and unintuitive portfolio allocations that are difficult\n",
    "to justify economically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Black–Litterman (BL) framework addresses this limitation by combining a\n",
    "market-implied equilibrium return vector with subjective investor views in a Bayesian\n",
    "setting. Rather than relying on direct forecasts of absolute returns, the model anchors\n",
    "expectations to a reference portfolio and incorporates views in a controlled and\n",
    "transparent manner. As a result, Black–Litterman portfolios tend to be more stable,\n",
    "diversified, and economically interpretable than those produced by unconstrained\n",
    "optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project applies the Black–Litterman framework to the construction of a global\n",
    "multi-asset portfolio comprising country-level equity indices, fixed income assets,\n",
    "and commodities. Compared to regionally aggregated equity exposures, the use of\n",
    "country-level indices introduces greater heterogeneity in volatility, correlations,\n",
    "and factor sensitivities, allowing macroeconomic and structural views to propagate\n",
    "more evenly across the portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "A central focus of the analysis is the interaction between equilibrium priors,\n",
    "subjective views, and portfolio risk. The views employed in this study are inspired in\n",
    "part by a growth-oriented scenario drawn from BlackRock’s capital market assumptions,\n",
    "including themes related to the diffusion of artificial intelligence and productivity\n",
    "enhancements. These views are not adopted mechanically; rather, they are selectively\n",
    "adapted and augmented to ensure economic coherence and to facilitate meaningful\n",
    "comparative analysis within the Black–Litterman framework. The objective is not to\n",
    "maximize expected returns, but to examine how the incorporation of such views reshapes\n",
    "expected returns, twists the efficient frontier, and influences portfolio allocations\n",
    "under realistic assumptions and uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main contributions of this project are threefold. First, it demonstrates the use\n",
    "of a factor-based covariance model within a global multi-asset Black–Litterman setting.\n",
    "Second, it introduces heterogeneous prior assumptions across asset classes,\n",
    "particularly for commodities, reflecting their distinct economic roles. Third, it\n",
    "provides a comprehensive empirical comparison of equilibrium and posterior portfolios,\n",
    "illustrating how investor views affect expected returns, diversification, and risk\n",
    "allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remainder of the report is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and\n",
    "asset universe. Section 3 outlines the methodological framework, including the\n",
    "construction of priors, views, and posterior estimates. Section 4 presents the\n",
    "empirical results and portfolio implications. Section 5 discusses robustness and\n",
    "limitations, and Section 6 concludes.\n",

    "## 2. Data and Asset Universe\n",
    "\n",
    "This section describes the asset universe, data sources, and sample period used in\n",
    "the empirical analysis. The portfolio is constructed as a global multi-asset\n",
    "investment universe comprising equities, fixed income, and commodities. The choice\n",
    "of assets is motivated by the need to capture heterogeneous sources of risk and\n",
    "return while maintaining sufficient historical depth for robust estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Asset Universe\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Equities\n",
    "\n",
    "Equity exposure is represented using country-level indices rather than aggregated\n",
    "regional benchmarks. This choice allows for greater differentiation in volatility,\n",
    "macroeconomic sensitivity, and factor exposure across markets. Country-level equities\n",
    "also enable macroeconomic views to propagate more evenly across the portfolio,\n",
    "reducing excessive concentration in a single regional equity allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equity universe includes the following markets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **United States (SPY):** Large-cap U.S. equities, representing the global technology\n",
    "  and innovation leader.\n",
    "- **Europe (VGK):** Developed European equities, capturing exposure to mature\n",
    "  industrial and consumer sectors.\n",
    "- **Japan (EWJ):** Japanese equities, reflecting corporate governance reform and\n",
    "  export-oriented growth.\n",
    "- **China (FXI):** Chinese large-cap equities, representing policy-driven growth and\n",
    "  global manufacturing exposure.\n",
    "- **India (INDY):** Indian large-cap equities, capturing structural growth and\n",
    "  productivity catch-up.\n",
    "- **Brazil (EWZ):** Brazilian equities, providing exposure to commodity-driven growth\n",
    "  and emerging market cyclicality.\n",
    "\n",
    "All equity series are sourced from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) available on Yahoo\n",
    "Finance, which provide transparent and liquid proxies for the underlying equity\n",
    "markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fixed Income\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed income exposure is constructed to clearly separate interest rate risk from\n",
    "credit risk. Rather than using a broad aggregate bond index, two distinct instruments\n",
    "are employed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **U.S. Treasury Bonds (IEF):** A government bond proxy representing pure duration\n",
    "  and interest rate exposure.\n",
    "- **Investment-Grade Corporate Credit (LQD):** U.S. corporate bonds providing exposure\n",
    "  to credit spreads and corporate balance sheet strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation allows interest rate and credit risks to be modeled independently in\n",
    "both the factor model and the Black–Litterman framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Commodities\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Broad Commodities (DBC):** A diversified commodity index capturing exposure to\n",
    "  energy, metals, and agricultural commodities. Commodities are included primarily for\n",
    "  diversification, inflation protection, and sensitivity to global investment cycles,\n",
    "  rather than long-term growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Data Sources and Sample Period\n",
    "\n",
    "Asset price data are obtained from Yahoo Finance and converted to monthly total\n",
    "returns using adjusted closing prices. Fixed income yields and macroeconomic series\n",
    "are sourced from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database, while equity factor\n",
    "data are obtained from the Fama–French data library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is conducted at a monthly frequency to balance statistical robustness\n",
    "with economic interpretability. The sample period begins in 2009, ensuring at least\n",
    "15 years of data availability across all assets while avoiding structural breaks\n",
    "associated with earlier market regimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"../figures/fig_2_1_cumulative_returns.png\" width=\"70%\">\n",
    "  <p><b>Figure 2.1:</b> <i>Cumulative Returns of Portfolio Assets (Monthly).</i></p>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2.1 shows the cumulative performance of all assets in the investment universe\n",
    "from the start of the sample period. The figure highlights substantial heterogeneity\n",
    "in long-term returns, volatility, and drawdown behavior across asset classes and\n",
    "regions, motivating the use of a diversified multi-asset framework and structured\n",
    "portfolio construction approach.\n",

    "Figure 2.2 presents the pairwise correlations of monthly asset returns over the sample period. While most assets exhibit positive correlation, meaningful differences in co-movement across regions and asset classes remain. This underscores the potential for diversification while also motivating the use of factor-based covariance estimation rather than reliance on raw sample correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Strategic Reference Allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "A strategic reference portfolio is used to infer equilibrium expected returns within\n",
    "the Black–Litterman framework. The reference allocation reflects a growth-oriented\n",
    "multi-asset mandate, with a dominant allocation to equities, complemented by fixed\n",
    "income and a modest allocation to commodities for diversification and inflation\n",
    "hedging.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the asset-class level, the reference portfolio allocates approximately:\n",
    "- **73% to equities**\n",
    "- **23% to fixed income**\n",
    "- **4% to commodities**\n",
    "\n",
    "Within equities, weights are distributed according to broad market capitalization\n",
    "proxies, while fixed income exposure is split evenly between government bonds and\n",
    "corporate credit. This reference portfolio is not intended to be optimal, but rather\n",
    "to represent a reasonable long-term market consensus around which active views are\n",
    "expressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further details on the construction of equilibrium returns and the role of the\n",

    "## 3. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "This section describes the portfolio construction framework employed in the study.\n",
    "The approach combines a factor-based risk model with the Black–Litterman (BL)\n",
    "framework to generate stable and economically interpretable expected returns and\n",
    "portfolio allocations. The methodology proceeds in four steps: covariance estimation,\n",
    "equilibrium return inference, specification of investor views, and portfolio\n",
    "optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Factor-Based Covariance Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Asset return covariance is estimated using a multi-factor model rather than relying\n",
    "on the sample covariance matrix. This choice is motivated by the instability of\n",
    "sample covariances in multi-asset settings and the desire to obtain a more structured\n",
    "and interpretable representation of risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each asset’s excess return is modeled as a linear function of systematic factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r_{i,t} = \\alpha_i + {\\beta_i}' f_t + \\varepsilon_{i,t}   \\tag{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f_t$ denotes a vector of factor returns and $\\varepsilon_{i,t}$ captures\n",
    "asset-specific risk. The factor set includes equity style factors, interest rate\n",
    "changes, credit spread dynamics, and commodity-related risk drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The asset covariance matrix is constructed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Sigma = B \\cdot Cov(f) \\cdot B' + D    \\tag{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $B$ contains estimated factor loadings, $Cov(f)$ is the factor\n",
    "covariance matrix, and $D$ is a diagonal matrix of idiosyncratic variances. To\n",
    "assess robustness, alternative covariance estimators—including shrinkage and\n",
    "exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) estimators—are later considered in the\n",
    "portfolio optimization stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Equilibrium Expected Returns\n",
    "\n",
    "The Black–Litterman framework requires a set of equilibrium expected returns that are\n",
    "consistent with a reference portfolio. These equilibrium returns are obtained via\n",
    "reverse optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Pi = \\lambda \\cdot \\Sigma \\cdot w_{ref}     \\tag{3} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Pi$ denotes the vector of implied excess returns, $\\Sigma$ is the asset\n",
    "covariance matrix, $w_{ref}$ represents the strategic reference allocation,\n",
    "and $\\lambda$ is the representative risk aversion coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reference portfolio reflects a growth-oriented multi-asset allocation and is not\n",
    "intended to be optimal. Rather, it serves as a neutral anchor representing long-term\n",
    "market consensus. The risk aversion parameter is inferred from long-term capital\n",
    "market assumptions to ensure consistency between expected returns and portfolio risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Prior Specification and Heterogeneous Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected return priors are constructed using long-term capital market assumptions for\n",
    "equities and fixed income assets. These assumptions provide stable estimates of\n",
    "long-run excess returns and volatilities consistent with institutional investment\n",
    "horizons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commodities are treated differently due to their lack of intrinsic cash flows and\n",
    "highly regime-dependent return behavior. Rather than relying on long-horizon\n",
    "historical averages, commodity expected returns are anchored at a small positive\n",
    "excess return with high uncertainty, while volatility is estimated over a shorter\n",
    "historical window. This specification reflects the role of commodities as\n",
    "diversifiers and inflation hedges rather than long-term growth assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This heterogeneous prior structure allows each asset class to be modeled in a manner\n",
    "consistent with its economic role while maintaining internal coherence within the\n",
    "Black–Litterman framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Black–Litterman Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Investor views are incorporated using the Black–Litterman Bayesian updating\n",
    "mechanism. Views are expressed in linear form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P \\cdot \\mu = Q + \\varepsilon  \\tag{4} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu$ is the vector of expected excess returns, $P$ is the pick matrix\n",
    "linking views to assets, $Q$ is the vector of view-implied excess returns, and\n",
    "$\\varepsilon$ represents view uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The posterior expected returns are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\mu^{BL} = \\Pi + \\tau \\Sigma P' (P \\tau \\Sigma P' + \\Omega)^{-1} (Q - P \\Pi) \\tag{5}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\tau$ is a scalar controlling the uncertainty of the prior and $\\Omega$\n",
    "is the covariance matrix of view errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Views are specified in relative return form to improve robustness and reduce\n",
    "sensitivity to absolute return forecasts. View uncertainty is calibrated using an\n",
    "Idzorek-style approach, whereby the variance of each view is proportional to the\n",
    "projected variance of the underlying assets scaled by subjective confidence levels.\n",
    "This ensures that no single view dominates the posterior unless supported by high\n",
    "confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.4.1 Specification of Investor Views\n",
    "\n",
    "Investor views are formulated based on a medium-term macroeconomic scenario\n",
    "characterized by the diffusion of artificial intelligence, productivity catch-up in\n",
    "emerging markets, and a moderation in developed market growth leadership. Rather than\n",
    "forecasting absolute returns, all views are expressed in relative form to enhance\n",
    "robustness and reduce sensitivity to estimation error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The views incorporate the following themes:\n",
    "- stronger growth in selected emerging markets (India, Brazil, China),\n",
    "- comparatively weaker growth in Europe,\n",
    "- stable but higher-for-longer interest rates favoring credit over duration,\n",
    "- continued relevance of commodities as diversification and inflation-sensitive assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each view is expressed as a linear combination of asset returns, summarized in Table 3.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Table 3.1: Summary of Black–Litterman Views**\n",
    "\n",
    "| View | Economic Interpretation | Mathematical Representation | Implied Excess Return (Q) |\n",

    "\n",
    "Once expected returns and covariances have been specified, portfolio construction is\n",
    "performed by solving a range of standard optimisation problems. Expected returns are\n",
    "taken either as the equilibrium prior vector $\\Pi$ or the Black–Litterman posterior\n",
    "vector $\\mu^{BL}$, while risk is measured using the covariance matrix $\\Sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "All optimisation problems impose the full-investment constraint\n",

    "The mean–variance portfolio maximises quadratic utility:\n",

    "and risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting allocations for each investor profile are compared in the empirical\n",
    "results section to illustrate how risk preferences interact with Black–Litterman\n",
    "posterior expected returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.6 Constrained Optimisation and Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, portfolio optimisation is subject to constraints reflecting regulatory,\n",
    "institutional, and implementability considerations. In this study, the following\n",
    "constraints are imposed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Budget constraint:** $\\mathbf{1}' w = 1$\n",
    "- **Long-only constraint:** $w_i \\ge 0$\n",
    "- **Weight caps:** $w_i \\le w_i^{\\max}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Under these constraints, the optimisation problems become quadratic or conic\n",
    "programmes that do not generally admit closed-form solutions. Portfolio weights are\n",
    "therefore obtained using numerical optimisation techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the impact of expected return assumptions, covariance estimation, and\n",
    "optimization objectives, a set of portfolios is constructed by combining alternative\n",
    "objective functions with different covariance estimators. All portfolios are subject\n",
    "to long-only constraints, a full investment constraint, and asset-specific maximum\n",
    "weight limits reflecting market size and liquidity considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Portfolio names follow a consistent convention. The prefix denotes the optimization\n",
    "objective, while the suffix identifies the covariance estimator employed. Three\n",
    "covariance estimators are considered: a factor-based covariance model, a Ledoit–Wolf\n",
    "shrinkage estimator, and an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization objectives examined are summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Minimum Variance (Min_Var)**: minimizes total portfolio variance without reference\n",
    "  to expected returns.\n",
    "- **Mean–Variance with Black–Litterman Returns (MV_BL)**: maximizes a quadratic utility\n",
    "  function using Black–Litterman posterior expected returns.\n",
    "- **Maximum Sharpe Ratio (MaxSharpe_BL)**: maximizes expected excess return per unit of\n",
    "  volatility using Black–Litterman posterior returns.\n",
    "- **Minimum Parametric Value-at-Risk (Min_VaR_5%)**: minimizes a parametric Value-at-Risk\n",
    "  measure at the 5% confidence level, incorporating both return and volatility.\n",
    "- **Minimum Tracking Error (Min_TE)**: minimizes deviation from the strategic reference\n",
    "  portfolio, subject to the covariance structure.\n",
    "- **Regularized Mean–Variance (MV_BL_Reg)**: mean–variance optimization with an\n",
    "  additional penalty that discourages large deviations from the reference portfolio,\n",
    "  improving stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each optimization objective is applied under alternative covariance estimators to\n",
    "assess robustness and sensitivity to risk modeling assumptions. These constrained portfolios form the basis of the empirical comparisons presented\n",
    "in the results section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.7 Interpretation and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The Black–Litterman framework does not aim to improve the efficient frontier in a\n",
    "purely mechanical sense. Instead, it produces posterior expected returns that reflect\n",
    "both market consensus and investor beliefs under uncertainty. As a result, posterior\n",
    "efficient frontiers may lie below their prior counterparts, reflecting more\n",
    "conservative and realistic return expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations of the approach include sensitivity to covariance estimation, the choice\n",
    "of view confidence parameters, and the tendency for correlations to increase during\n",
    "periods of market stress. These limitations are explored further in the empirical\n",
    "results and robustness analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.8 Factor Study and Systematic Backtesting\n",
    "\n",
    "Before engaging in portfolio optimisation, the factor set is analysed as an object of\n",
    "study in its own right. This serves two purposes. First, it validates that the chosen\n",
    "factors exhibit distinct risk–return characteristics and are not redundant with the\n",
    "market factor. Second, it provides economic context for the factor-based covariance\n",
    "model used later in portfolio construction.\n",

    "## 5. Robustness and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "This section evaluates the robustness of the Black–Litterman portfolio results to key\n",
    "modeling choices and highlights inherent limitations of the approach. Given the\n",
    "well-known sensitivity of optimized portfolios to expected returns, covariance\n",
    "estimates, and subjective views, robustness analysis is essential for interpreting the\n",
    "empirical findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "All sensitivity tests are conducted under explicit long-only and asset-level weight\n",
    "constraints, reflecting realistic implementation limits and preventing economically\n",
    "implausible concentration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Sensitivity to Prior Uncertainty ($\\tau$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter $\\tau$ controls the uncertainty assigned to the equilibrium prior expected\n",
    "returns. Smaller values of $\\tau$ place greater weight on the market-implied equilibrium,\n",
    "while larger values increase the relative influence of investor views.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across a broad range of $\\tau$ values (0.01 to 0.10), posterior allocations remain\n",
    "qualitatively stable. While the magnitude of tilts toward emerging market equities and\n",
    "away from U.S. equities varies with $\\tau$, the identity of the assets receiving overweight\n",
    "and underweight positions is largely preserved. This indicates that the posterior\n",
    "results are not driven by an extreme or finely tuned choice of prior uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, binding asset-level weight constraints play a stabilizing role: as $\\tau$\n",
    "increases, allocations tend to reach prescribed maximum weights rather than diverging\n",
    "further. This behavior reflects realistic portfolio construction limits and prevents\n",
    "excessive sensitivity to subjective inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Sensitivity to View Confidence ($\\Omega$)\n",
    "\n",
    "View confidence is incorporated through the view error covariance matrix $\\Omega$. Scaling $\\Omega$\n",
    "up or down uniformly corresponds to decreasing or increasing confidence in the\n",
    "specified views.\n",
    "\n",
    "As view confidence increases (lower $\\Omega$ scaling), posterior allocations move further\n",
    "away from the equilibrium prior toward assets favored by the macroeconomic scenario,\n",
    "particularly emerging market equities. Conversely, higher $\\Omega$ scaling dampens the impact\n",
    "of views, producing allocations closer to the reference portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially, even under high-confidence scenarios, posterior portfolios do not exhibit\n",
    "extreme concentration. The combination of relative-return views, explicit uncertainty\n",
    "calibration, and binding weight constraints ensures that allocations remain\n",
    "well-diversified. This robustness highlights a key practical advantage of the\n",
    "Black–Litterman framework over unconstrained mean–variance optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3 Joint Sensitivity to $\\tau$ and $\\Omega$\n",
    "\n",
    "Joint variation of $\\tau$ and $\\Omega$ confirms that posterior allocations respond smoothly to\n",
    "changes in modeling assumptions. Allocation shifts occur along intuitive dimensions—\n",
    "such as equity versus fixed income and developed versus emerging markets—without\n",
    "producing abrupt or unstable portfolio behavior.\n",

    "portfolio constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.5 Correlation Regimes and Market Stress\n",
    "\n",
    "A key limitation of any mean–variance–based framework is the implicit assumption of\n",
    "stable correlations. Empirical evidence shows that asset correlations tend to increase\n",
    "during periods of market stress, thereby reducing the effectiveness of diversification\n",

    "The Black–Litterman framework does not eliminate this structural limitation. While the\n",
    "posterior allocations derived in this study are more balanced and robust under normal\n",
    "market conditions, diversification benefits may deteriorate during systemic risk\n",
    "events. In such environments, assets that appear weakly correlated in tranquil\n",
    "periods can become highly correlated as liquidity constraints and risk aversion\n",
    "increase across markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accordingly, Black–Litterman portfolios should be interpreted as strategic or\n",
    "medium-term allocations rather than as tactical risk-off hedges. Stress testing,\n",
    "scenario analysis, and complementary risk management tools remain essential when\n",
    "deploying such portfolios in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.6 Model Risk and Practical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Several sources of model risk must be acknowledged. First, expected returns remain the\n",
    "most uncertain inputs in portfolio construction, even within the Black–Litterman\n",
    "framework. Although Bayesian shrinkage improves stability, posterior expected returns\n",
    "still depend on assumptions regarding prior uncertainty, view specification, and\n",
    "confidence calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, factor models and covariance estimators rely on historical relationships that\n",
    "may not persist across future regimes. Structural shifts in macroeconomic conditions,\n",
    "monetary policy, or market microstructure can alter both factor premia and asset\n",
    "correlations. Third, the formulation of investor views and confidence levels introduces\n",
    "an unavoidable degree of subjectivity, which must be managed through discipline and\n",
    "economic justification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these limitations, the Black–Litterman framework offers a transparent and\n",
    "coherent methodology for incorporating subjective beliefs into portfolio\n",
    "construction. By anchoring expectations to a reference portfolio and explicitly\n",
    "modeling uncertainty, the framework mitigates many of the instabilities and extreme\n",
    "allocations associated with traditional mean–variance optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.7 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The robustness analysis demonstrates that the empirical results are not driven by\n",
    "arbitrary parameter choices or fragile modeling assumptions. While portfolio allocations\n",
    "vary with prior uncertainty, view confidence, and covariance estimation techniques, the\n",
    "qualitative conclusions remain stable across a wide range of specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the findings reinforce the value of the Black–Litterman framework as a\n",

    "## 6. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project applied the Black–Litterman framework to the construction of a global\n",
    "multi-asset portfolio comprising country-level equity indices, fixed income assets,\n",
    "and commodities. By combining a factor-based covariance model with equilibrium\n",
    "expected returns and explicitly stated relative views, the analysis demonstrated how\n",
    "investor beliefs can be incorporated in a disciplined manner while controlling\n",
    "estimation risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirically, the introduction of Black–Litterman posterior returns resulted in a\n",
    "systematic moderation of expected excess returns across all assets. Equilibrium\n",
    "expected returns ranging from approximately 3–6% annually were reduced to a narrower\n",
    "posterior range of ~ 1.5–3.5%, reflecting Bayesian shrinkage and explicit\n",
    "uncertainty modeling. This moderation translated into a posterior efficient frontier\n",
    "that lay below the prior frontier across most volatility levels, emphasizing robustness\n",
    "over optimistic return forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Portfolio allocations exhibited economically meaningful shifts. Relative to the\n",
    "strategic reference allocation, U.S. equity exposure declined from over 50% in the\n",
    "prior to approximately 20–40% under moderate risk aversion, while allocations to\n",
    "emerging market equities—particularly India, China, and Brazil—increased materially.\n",
    "These shifts are consistent with growth and productivity catch-up dynamics emphasized\n",
    "in contemporary capital market outlooks, including AI-driven investment themes.\n",
    "European equities remained persistently underweighted, reflecting weaker growth\n",
    "expectations and regulatory constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across optimization objectives, posterior portfolios demonstrated improved\n",
    "diversification characteristics. Effective numbers of bets increased from\n",
    "approximately 3 in minimum variance portfolios to over 4 in Black–Litterman\n",
    "mean–variance portfolios, while risk contributions became more evenly distributed\n",
    "across asset classes. Fixed income assets continued to provide volatility dampening,\n",
    "with investment-grade credit favored over government bonds, and commodities maintained\n",
    "a persistent allocation driven by diversification and inflation sensitivity rather\n",
    "than return maximization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robustness analysis confirmed that these qualitative conclusions were stable across\n",
    "alternative assumptions regarding prior uncertainty, view confidence, and covariance\n",
    "estimation. While absolute allocations varied with parameter choices, the direction of\n",
    "allocation shifts and diversification outcomes remained consistent. This finding\n",
    "aligns with industry practice, where Black–Litterman is used as a strategic allocation\n",
    "tool rather than a source of aggressive tactical bets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the results reinforce the value of the Black–Litterman framework as a practical\n",
    "portfolio construction methodology. Rather than seeking mechanical improvements in\n",
    "mean–variance efficiency, the framework provides a transparent mechanism to balance\n",
    "market consensus with investor beliefs, producing stable and economically interpretable\n",
    "portfolios under uncertainty. Future extensions could explore dynamic or regime-based\n",
